# grow
Game built with Construct 2

The examples and idea comes from a training course for the Construct 2 game builder system.
By following the instructions, building your own images and coding for Construct 2, the 
result is this javascript system. 

This fun and addictive game has the goal of your ship must collide with enemy ships that
are smaller than your ship.  As you collide with an enemy ship that is smaller than you,
your ship grows in size.  If you collide with an enemy that is larger than you, your ship
reverts to its original size.  One catch is that as your ship grows, so does the average
size of the enemy ships.
